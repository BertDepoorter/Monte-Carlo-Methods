# Monte Carlo Methods

This repository contains my code for the course on Monte Carlo Methods at Ku Leuven, written by myself for the examination. 
The course is thaught by Prof. Enrico Carlon and covers an introduction to Monte carlo methods, treats different sampling methods like the Ising model, Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, heat bath, cluster algorithm, Potts model.
Also some attention is given to the simulation of out of equilibrium systems.
